Hi OsirisX

It has been many years since the core installer has been updated and I wanted to ask whether it is possible now to port the dolphin emulator core to your ps4 port of retroarch. 
I know initially some cores were not ported because the OpenOrbis SDK lacked functionality, but since many years have passed I thought maybe it had gained these functions, thus allowing some of the missing cores to be ported.

Thanks
